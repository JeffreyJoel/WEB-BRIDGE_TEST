# React QUiz
This is my submission for the Web3Bridge Assessment. This project was built with React and styled using Bootstrap 5.

## Function
* This project asks a user a series of questions one at a time and displays their results at the end.
* An array is used to store an array of questions.
* Each question array contains an object that contains the actual list of answers and a boolean value that shows whether or not the answer is correct. 
* Once an answer is clicked, the app takes the user to the next question and displays the final answer at the end.
* There is an otion to go back and re-take the test.
